## Hwid Verificator
Java HWID verificator (for most of the clients)

## Read Me
This tool will generate your HWID in desktop (on .txt format) 

## Usage
Call `HwidVerificator.verify();` on the main class

 - In order to implement a HWID system on your mods or clients, you should create a github / pastebin paste and paste all the valid hwids
 - - You should also obfuscate the urls or host it on a private vps so nobody can get the hwids
 - - Also you should try to hide the hwid verification as better as possible so people can't remove it using bytecode or decompilers.
 
 A good tip is hiding it on one of your mod injections, like Minecraft or GuiMainMenu, but there are plenty other ways to hide it.
 
 This HWID system is made by Halqq btw
